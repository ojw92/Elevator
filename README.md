# Elevator
elevator project

The elevator project was motivated by my personal unsatisfactory experience with the elevator at my apartment.

Points to consider:
 - time for elevator to stop at a floor, open door & close door
 - time for elevator to move from one floor to the next
 - time from starting floor to next floor as it accelerates & 2nd to last floor to last floor as it deccelerates
 - for simplicity of problem, assume electrical energy spent & durability of equipment are negligible

Problem statement:
 - goal is to minimize time.
 1. what is the maximum difference in floors between 2 ppl for an elevator to choose to pick up the person on the higher floor, then the lower floor, and still be efficient?
 2. (For 2 elevators) What is the minimum difference in floors between 2 ppl for elevator 1 to choose person 1 over person 2 so elevator 2 can stop at person 2?
 3. How can the algorithm be designed to prioritize different goals (time-efficient (person-centric), energy-efficient (machine-centric), philanthropic, etc)?




Currently in progress for ironing out the details of the algorithm. More to come!
